<h1>BASIC CONCEPTS OF NURSING INFORMATICS</h1>
<p>Information technology (IT) embraces the development, implementation, and management of computer systems, networks, and software applications. It plays a crucial role in modern society especially in nursing practice, enabling communication, information sharing, and automation across various sectors.</p>

<h2>What is Nursing Informatics?</h2>
<center><img src="https://writingfuturehealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-trends-for-NI.png"  width="700" height="400">
<p>According to the <em>American Nurses Association</em>, nursing informatics "is the specialty that integrates
nursing science with multiple information and analytical sciences to identify, define, manage and
communicate data, information, knowledge and wisdom in nursing practice." It deals more on the
processing of information in the healthcare settings like inputting monitored vital signs and/or carrying out
physicians’ order to laboratory department etc.<br><br><em>Ball and Hannah</em> modified an early definition of medical informatics, acknowledging that all health care professionals are part of medical informatics. Therefore, nursing informatics was “those collected informational technologies which concern themselves with the patient care decision-making process performed by health care practitioners.” Shortly after this, Hannah continued the emphasis on technology and added the concept of the nursing role within nursing informatics:
<p><small><em>"The use of information technologies in relation to those functions within the purview of nursing, and that are carried out by nurses when performing their duties. Therefore, any use of information technologies by nurses in relation to the care of their patients, the administration of health care facilities, or the educational preparation of individuals to practice the discipline is considered nursing informatics"</em></small><?p>

     <li>Settlement for patient care</li>
     <li>Legal & Ethical Implications</li>
     <li>Safety & Quality issues</li>
</ol>     

<h2>Theories and Frameworks</h2>
<p>Nursing theories are organized, knowledge-based concepts that essentially define the scope of nursing practice. This scope would include what constitutes nursing, what nurses are typically tasked with, and the reasons why these tasks are in place.The framework for nursing informatics relies on the core concepts DATA, INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE. These three will result to a decision making to resolve
the problem.</p>

<h3>Information Science</h3>
<p>Information science is an interdisciplinary field that encompasses the study of the gathering, organization, management, retrieval, and storage of recorded knowledge. It examines the interplay between humans and machines in the communication process, seeking to understand how individuals interact with information systems and how these systems can be designed to effectively solve problems. Information science has three main branches: information retrieval, human-computer interactions, and information handling within a system. Information retrieval focuses on techniques for gathering and accessing data, such as search engines and databases. Human-computer interactions explore how humans interact with computers, including the design of user interfaces and the study of cognitive processes involved in information processing. Information handling within a system examines how information is managed and processed within a computer system, considering both the capabilities of the software and the skills of the human users. By studying these aspects, information science aims to advance our understanding of how information is created, disseminated, and utilized in the digital age.</p>

<h3>Cognitive Science</h3> 
<p>Cognitive pertains to thinking or simply how
minds process information. Cognitive science is
the study of mind and the thinking process.
Computers, cellular phones and web browsers
are technology coming from cognitive science
which helps in learning, memory, problem
solving, and living daily life in modern society.</p>

<h3>Computer Science</h3>
<p>Computer science is the study of algorithms for
solving computation problems. If an algorithm
can be identified for solving a particular problem,
an automated solution to the problem can be
developed. Once an automated solution is
developed, a machine can be built to solve the
solution without the person or machine needing
to understand the solution. A computer is a tool
of science, not the main focus (Bickford& Hunter
2015).</p>

<h3>Communication Theory</h3>
<center><img src="https://cdn.sketchbubble.com/pub/media/catalog/product/optimized1/e/5/e5a6b45b85ec91f910cf7db06975c12e5cc3e3a45b421ff71ff59f621d7407f9/communication-theory-mc-slide2.png" width="700" height="320">
<p>To analyze information transfer, effectiveness
and efficiency of communications there is a core
concepts and principles developed. The
communication channel describes how the
data was sent, its channel and how it was
received. If the sender’s information rate is
below the channel capacity, there is a way to
encode the information so that it can be
received without errors. The channel might
change or misrepresent the message upon
transmission.<p>

<h3>Systems Theory</h3>
<p>This theory focuses on the organization and
interdependence of relationship within a system.
System means any set of group that is
interdependent to each other. Parts are system
themselves and are composed of other parts.
<br>A system could be either: Open or Closed:<br><br>
<u><em>Open System -</em></u>can be influenced by events
outside of the actual or conceptual scopes.
Information systems and humans are considered
open system.
<u><br><br><em>Closed System -</em></u>does not interact with the
surrounding environment. It has impermeable
boundary
<em>(Bickford& Hunter 2015)</em>.<p>

<h2>Models related to Nursing Informatics</h2>

<h3>GRAVES AND CORCORAN’S MODEL</h3>
<center><img src="https://cf.son.umaryland.edu/NURS310/pic/management_processing.png"  width="500" height="200">
<p>According to this model, nursing informatics as
the linear headway, from data into information
and knowledge. Management processing is
integrated within each element, showing nursing
informatics as the proper management of
knowledge, from data as it is converted into
information and knowledge.</p>

<h3>SCHIWIRIAN’S MODEL</h3>
<center><img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiYeBLkxwcb7CbIXjJ5uFj2Qvx32ClSPn4eRweSw_ZUtKlsBxFEddiH7sfuVxpnP0L9KqjMIzpQmQv7xRz9FysfJKAUmyMnYsdqiMncKm8LDdDtGJxPc0r6TSyqlvF3ZK3zzkaKPeG2YjI/s1600/SCHWIRIAN%25E2%2580%2599S%252BMODEL%252BGOAL%252BUSERS%252BTECHNOLOGY%252BRAW%252BMATERIALS.jpg"  width="500" height="200">
<p>According to <em>Patricia Schwirian</em> – nursing
informatics involves identification of information
needs, resolution of the needs, and attainment of
nursing goals/objectives. proposed a model
intended to stimulate and guide systematic
research in nursing informatics. This model is
somehow related to Maslow Hierarchy of Needs
that display the leveling of necessity or
systematic approach.</p>

<h3>TURLEY’S MODEL</h3>

<p>Turley’s model is represented by intersecting
circle which about nursing informatics with
connection between the discipline-specific
science or nursing and the area of informatics.
This model has 3 core components: (1) Cognitive
science, (2) Information science, and (3)
Computer science.</p>

<h3>McGONIGLE and MASTRIAN</h3>
<center><img src="https://d45jl3w9libvn.cloudfront.net/jaypee/static/books/9789351522010/Chapters/images/1092-1.jpg"  width="500" height="300">
<p>They developed the foundation of knowledge
model. Nursing informatics is a developing,
dynamic process involving the translation of data
into information, and knowledge. The base of the
model shows the random distribution of data and
information. Knowledge processing is
represented by the intersection of the three
cones.</p>

<h3>CLINICAL-INFORMATION-SYSTEM (CIS) MODEL</h3>
<center><img src="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327291244/figure/fig1/AS:666000047484929@1535798193808/nfrastructure-and-flows-in-clinical-information-systems.png"  width="500" height="200">
<p>The purpose of this model is to depict system
components, influencing factors and relationship
that need to be considered when attempting to
capture the complexities of professional nursing
practiced. This tries to show how it is used to
organized different concepts into logical whole

<h2>What Is the Value of Nursing Informatics in Health Care?</h2>
<p><u><em>Improved patient care and outcomes.</em></u> Optimized EHRs can allow nurses and other health care providers to quickly glean patient information if data is collected, analyzed, and shared effectively.<br><br>
<u><em>Enhanced patient safety.</em></u> More accurate documentation and better access to patient information may minimize medical errors and improve communication between health care providers and patients. <br> <br>
<u><em>Streamlined workflow.</em></u> Improved efficiency and simpler workloads reduce the time and frustration that nurses may have with administrative burdens, allowing more time for patient care. <br> <br>
<u><em>Research and quality improvements</em></u>.  Access to timely, correct data and the ability to analyze it can support research, quality improvement initiatives, and innovation. These efforts may assist in implementing evidence-based practice. <br> <br>
<u><em>Virtual care.</em></u> During the COVID-19 pandemic, nursing informatics stepped up to implement and support more telehealth and virtual health care platforms. <br> <br>
<u><em>Data-driven decision making.</em></u> Access to real-time data and analytics can allow for better-informed decisions and proactive care interventions. </p>

<br>

<p>Nursing informatics is a fast-growing field that plays a vital role in leveraging technology and data to transform health care delivery, enhance patient outcomes, and advance the nursing profession. This nursing role bridges a health care organization's systems, nursing staff, and providers, including nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives. Incorporating informatics in nursing offers valuable input into how technological systems should be designed and implemented from a nursing perspective.
